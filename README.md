# QGIS_Feature_Viewer_Plugin
This QGIS plugin allows the user to upload files, validate them, and find the distance between features given index numbers. This repository will be updated as time passes.

In order to install this plugin, you will want to download all files in the master branch, try not to change file order as it may confuse QGIS. Once all files are downloaded, navigate to:

C:\Users\<your_user_file>\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins

Once here, insert the Plugin and it should work.

Note, if you want to change the functionality or add features, you will also want to add Plugin Reloader and Plugin Builder if you want to make your own plugins for QGIS.
*Disclaimer: the current version of this plugin, at least on my computer, is having issues with not loading in the plugin logo, this will be fixed ASAP. However, all other functionality is not impacted by this issue*
